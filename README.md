## What is ArchiveScape?

ArchiveScape is a public archive of [VentScape](https://ventscape.life). This archive was started on April 12, 2024 at 17:00 UTC and it is currently being updated every 5 minutes.

## Why Create ArchiveScape?

You might be wondering, "Doesn't this website defeat the whole purpose of VentScape?" The answer is yes (╥﹏╥), but it's very unlikely that I am the only person recording messages from VentScape. Does that justify me also doing it? The answer is no (ง ͠ಥ_ಥ)ง, but at least I am making a semi-useful website out of it.

## Project Structure

The code of this project is split into two parts: the frontend (this repo) and the collection script. The frontend is a Next.js app that you can find [here](https://github.com/LoV432/archivescape) . The collection script is a JS/TS script that runs a Puppeteer instance to record messages from [VentScape](https://ventscape.life) . You can find the code [here](https://github.com/LoV432/ventscape-archive) .

## Disclaimer

ArchiveScape is run by a completely separate person and has no connection to the original developer of [VentScape](https://ventscape.life) .
